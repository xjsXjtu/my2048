Features:
1. Any size of n*n (n>=2);
2. New added numbers:
	2.1 probability distribution is (2:66%, 4:33%), which is easier compared to (2:50%, 4:50%)
	2.2 These numbers may be added in any empty cells by uniform distribution.

Limited:
1. Currently only tested on Windows VC compiler. But it should be easy to ported to Linux. I try to write with standard C language.

Next steps:
1. an auto-play robot.
